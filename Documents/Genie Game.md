# Pitch
Gerald the Genie is excited that their lamp has been found. In that excitement though, it seems they are going overboard on every wish. Perhaps he can still win over his callers?

Each caller makes a wish, which Gerald puts his own quirky spin on. You play through these wishes as 2D side-scrolling sequences. To win over the caller, Gerald needs to use ideas he finds along the way to modify the level and make good on the wish. Between gameplay sections or at big gameplay beats, Gerald and the callers have a dialogue exploring their characters and why they made each wish.

# Gameplay Mechanics

## Wishes
Each wish is its own level, for all intents and purposes. Wishes are played out in 3D sections where the player guides the caller and tries to complete the wish.
### Traits
Traits can be found at preset locations in the world or in the shop. Traits have a pre-programmed functionality that gets applied to the scene.

> [!example]
> **Out of this World** :
> Reduces gravity by 50%.

Some modifiers last for the duration of a wish; others might be instant or temporary. Modifiers that are instant or temporary will have cooldowns to prevent spam.
### Callers
Each caller (the person to have summoned the genie) has a hidden condition that must be met to complete a wish. The condition should be discovered by dialogue or gameplay events.

Additionally, callers have affinities and aversions. For example, a caller that is scared of fire might backtrack or freeze up if you were to light an object on fire.
## Conversations
Between wishes or at certain gameplay events, the player enters a dialogue with the caller. Dialogue is completely linear with no branching. Conversations are an opportunity for players to learn more about each character.
## Pennies
The player can find pennies throughout the level, after completing objectives, or by completing a wish. Pennies can be used to purchase new traits.
### Shops
The player can always access the shop while in a wish. Using pennies, the player can buy traits that may prove useful during a wish. The shop's contents remains until a trait is purchased, thus rerolling that slot.
