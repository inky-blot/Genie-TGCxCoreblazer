>The narrative fall of the story, ending in the story's climax. Following the events of the last act, Jinan tries to take to heart the advice of their last caller -- to give exactly what is asked for, and nothing more. However, when [[Richard]] finds the lamp and asks for drink after drink, Jinan feels uncomfortable granting his wish again and again. As Rich gets more belligerent, Jinan is forced to make the tough decision to cut him off before he hurts himself or others.

## Beats
1. **Opening Dialogue Sequence**
Richard, clearly drunk, acquires the lamp and summons the genie. Jinan grants him one drink, then two, then more. By the third drink, the level transitions to the next beat.
2. **Light Platforming Sequence**
With Richard getting more drunk, the gameplay switches to light platforming as Richard takes the lamp from the shop out into the streets. Jinan demands him to stop, but Rich will only return the lamp if Jinan keeps giving him drinks. With each drink, camera and environment distortions get progressively worse.
3. **On-Rails Section**
Jinan realizes that things will only get worse if they comply. Rich grows into a large monster form, and Jinan rotates to face away from the camera. The player must shoot alcohol bubbles and a pint of beer out of the sky as Rich becomes angrier and angrier.
4. **Climax**
Back to a dialogue sequence, Richard yells at Jinan for not giving him more booze. Jinan screams back no and that they are cutting him off. Richard, angry, takes a drunken swing at Jinan -- missing and drunkenly collapsing to the floor. Jinan catches their breath and waits for help.
