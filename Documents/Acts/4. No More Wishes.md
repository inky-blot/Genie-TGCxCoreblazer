1. **Dialogue Section**
Paramedics and [[Corey]] arrive to help Richard. Daniya finally returns, worried sick about Jinan after she couldn't find their lamp. The two embrace as Jinan breaks down, pleading that they wont need to grant any more wishes. Jinan mourning that by giving those wishes, Richard got hurt; Daniya reminds them that they didn't need to save him, and yet they did. That was itself a generous and selfless act. Daniya promises that it's over, and they can just go home. Fade to credits.
