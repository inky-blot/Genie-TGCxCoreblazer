> The exposition and inciting incident of the story. [[Jinan]]'s lamp is found by [[Daniya]] in an old antiques shop. She asks for a wish, specifically for the wedding she never had. Jinan grants it, but goes so over-the-top that it nearly collapses in on itself. The wedding survives in the end, but there is no groom; Daniya laughs it off and declares it a friend wedding, to commemorate their new friendship with Jinan.
