### History
Daniya has lived a colorful life, as she was the first in her family to graduate from college since her grandfather immigrated to the west. She finished her degree in art history and began working as a restoration expert for various museums. She married a coworker and started a family; however, the spark fizzled out and she drifted away from her husband. After their children left for college, they split up, leaving Daniya with an empty home. She always did mourn that her marriage wasn't all that she dreamed when she was young, but was otherwise content with her life path. 
### Meets by
Daniya discovers Jinan's lamp in an old antiques store while browsing for her own collection. She's so overjoyed by the excitement of finding a genie, she asks if she's allowed a wish (Jinan didn't know that was an expectation in pop culture).
### Motives
She isn't in a hurry to find love, but she's saddened to have missed all the theatrics of a perfect wedding day.
