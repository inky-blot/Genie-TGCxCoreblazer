### Aesthetics
- Just a lil' fella.
- Lebanese pop fashion.
### History
Jinan's lamp has existed since the 11th century, during which they walked among mortals to inspire art and poetry. In those days, they didn't really grant wishes (that's a pop culture thing that came later), but they're totally fine playing that up. After their lamp was lost and later sold to the west, they were not called by a mortal again until the modern day.
